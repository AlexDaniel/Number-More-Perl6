Possible future features
========================

allow addition and subtraction between two numbers with different bases (as
  long as no negative number will result)
  (note tha Perl 6 already allows that between decimal, octal, binary,
  and hexadecimal numbers)

bases 37 through 62 (and possibly variants, see Wikipedia)

add named param to add 'base-X' to a transformed number (position?)

add bases higher than 62 with named character sets
